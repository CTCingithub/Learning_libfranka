# 连接机器人

## 1. 官方示例程序

物理连接好机器人，并激活`FCI`后，可通过官方示例程序`print_joint_poses`得到机器人当前各关节位姿。

```console
$ print_joint_poses 172.16.0.2

```

源代码`print_joint_poses.cpp`主题部分如下：

```c++
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  if (argc != 2) {
    std::cerr << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <robot-hostname>" << std::endl;
    return -1;
  }

  try {
    franka::Robot robot(argv[1]);

    franka::RobotState state = robot.readOnce();

    franka::Model model(robot.loadModel());
    for (franka::Frame frame = franka::Frame::kJoint1; frame <= franka::Frame::kEndEffector;
         frame++) {
      std::cout << model.pose(frame, state) << std::endl;
    }
  } catch (franka::Exception const& e) {
    std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
    return -1;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## 2. 主要修改

使用`yaml-cpp`库，将机器人IP地址放在配置文件中，从而使项目更规范。

```c++
std::string file = std::filesystem::current_path().parent_path().string() + "/config/FR3.yaml";
    YAML::Node config = YAML::LoadFile(file);
    const std::string robot_ip = config["Robot_ip"].as<std::string>();
    std::cout << "IP Address of Franka Research 3 Robot:" << robot_ip << std::endl;
```

这里读取一次关节角度，并输出到终端。

```c++
franka::Robot Myrobot(robot_ip);
franka::RobotState current_state = Myrobot.readOnce();

// Print Read Joint Angle(rad)
std::cout << "Read Joint Angle(rad): "
          << current_state.q << std::endl;

// Print Read Joint Angle(degree)
std::cout << "Read Joint Angle(degree): [";
for (const auto &joint : current_state.q)
{
  std::cout << joint / M_PI * 180;
  if (&joint != &current_state.q.back())
  {
    std::cout << ", ";
  }
}
std::cout << "]" << std::endl;
```

运行结果：

```console
$ ./01_access_robot 
IP Address of Franka Research 3 Robot: 172.16.0.2
Read Joint Angle(rad): [0.0872911, -0.744719, 0.0296455, -2.21447, 0.00365254, 1.49453, 0.876626]
Read Joint Angle(degree): [5.00141, -42.6693, 1.69856, -126.88, 0.209275, 85.6305, 50.227]
```
